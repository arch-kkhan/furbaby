                    We found that pet owners weren’t interested in an at-home video monitoring system while they 
                    were away at work. Especially, they’re not worried when their pets were well trained or grown 
                    older. However, they were more concerned with the entertainment of their pet and their social 
                    anxiety when out in public.

                    Our team targeted audiences at the pet saturated places such as parks with heavy traffic, 
                    pet stores, and local dog parks. We initially posted a survey with about 12 questions, 
                    conducted about 10 street interviews and 4 user interviews. Everyone that participated 
                    was a pet owner. Our initial user research revealed that primary users wouldn’t be as 
                    interested in an at-home video monitoring system for their dog, but more so reliable 
                    entertainment and an increase in social interaction with their dogs. With these new findings, 
                    we pivoted our user research to focus more on entertainment and interaction within the dog community. 
                    With the data from the tailored survey and street interview questions, we transformed our objective to 
                    focus on the reduction of separation and social anxiety through the social engagement of the dog community.

                    Currently, there are mobile applications that connect dog owners to local dog services and products. 
                    They satisfy the proximity concept that users prefer while exploring for appropriate, however they really 
                    don’t have the social aspects that allows you to virtually engage with other dog owners and potentially 
                    earn rewards.

                    Our team consisted of Asante Bell, Cindy Guo and myself. As this was one of our first UX Projects, 
                    our desire was to understand and analyze each phase together. Throughout the three weeks of research 
                    and design, we collaborated extensively. There were discussions and a lot of debates which was a guiding 
                    force that helped us grow as designers and collaborators.

                    After conducting our user research and interviews, we needed to creatively release our ideas. 
                    The “I like, I wish, What if?” exercise really helped eliminate our limited thoughts. 
                    As designers, we had to put ourselves in the shoes of our potential users.
